## User Stories / Approach Taken
As an avid music listener I make playlists for almost every occasion and am very particular to what music fits in certain instances such as the time of day, the weather outside and the time of year. So I wanted to create an app that created those playlists for me according to real time data on my app.

## Future Goals
My original goal was to implement live data from my personal Apple Music account in order to automatically create playlists according to real time data. One of my bigger goals was to implement a real time Weather API and connect it to my music so that it would generate playlists according to what the weather was like when I listened to certain songs.

## Unsolved Problems
Since I am not creating an App to be deployed as an app within Apple's App Store I was unable to access the Apple Music API needed to reach my original goals.
